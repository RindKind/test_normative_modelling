"""
    This function is a motherfunction that executes all parallel normative
    modelling routines. Different specifications are possible using the sub-
    functions.
    ** Input:
        * processing_dir     -> Full path to the processing directory. 
                                This will be the directory which you have   
                                cloned from Rindkind/test_normative_modeling.
        * python_path        -> Full path to the python distribution
        * normative_path     -> Full path to the normative.py
        * job_name           -> Name for the bash script that is the output of
                                this function
        * covfile_path       -> Full path to a .txt file that contains all
                                covariats (subjects x covariates) for the
                                responsefile
        * respfile_path      -> Full path to a .txt that contains all features
                                (subjects x features)
        * batch_size         -> Number of features in each batch
        * memory             -> Memory requirements written as string
                                for example 4gb or 500mb
        * duation            -> The approximate duration of the job, a string
                                with HH:MM:SS for example 01:01:01
        * cv_folds           -> Number of cross validations
        * testcovfile_path   -> Full path to a .txt file that contains all
                                covariats (subjects x covariates) for the
                                testresponse file
        * testrespfile_path  -> Full path to a .txt file that contains all
                                test features
        * log_path           -> Pathfor saving log files
        * binary             -> If True uses binary format for response file
                                otherwise it is text
    written by (primarily) T Wolfers, (adapted) SM Kia
